 * Current predictions:
 * Bubble Sort:
 * 	Worst: The list in descending order
 * 		With descending order, the sum of the distances between a value and it's final resting place is as big as it can be, so many swaps are required
 *  Best: The list is in ascending order
 * 		With ascending order, no swaps are required
 * Selection Sort:
 * 	There is no best and worst case, it is the same for each because it must always check for the greatest
 * 		It will swap even if the values are in the final resting place 
 * Insertion Sort:
 * 	Worst: The list in descending order
 *  	With descending order, the sum of the distances between a value and it's final resting place is as big as it can be, so many swaps are required
 *  Best: The list is in ascending order
 * 		The list is already sorted, so no swaps are required
