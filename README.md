## Current predictions:
### Bubble Sort:
Worst: The list in descending order
  * With descending order, the sum of the distances between the values and their final resting place is as big as it can be, so many swaps are required


Best: The list is in ascending order
  * With ascending order, no swaps are required

  * O(n<sup>2</sup>) 

### Selection Sort:
  * There is no best and worst case, it is the same for each because it must always check for the greatest
  * It will swap even if the values are in the final resting place

  * O(n) 

### Insertion Sort:
Worst: The list in descending order
  * With descending order, the sum of the distances between the values and their final resting place is as big as it can be, so many swaps are required


Best: The list is in ascending order
  * The list is already sorted, so no swaps are required
